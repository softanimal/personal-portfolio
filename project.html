          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p class="pading">The cloud storage industry is on the rise with new web applications continually hitting the market. It’s expected to grow by 24% by the year 2022. I designed a prototype for a cloud storage system that’s dexterous, effective and aims to appeal to both the youth and business demographics.</p>
          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>Cloud and organization storage systems are a competitive market, yet many users are still frustrated with their experience. From security concerns to usability issues and affordability, users are still seeking an absolute application that meets all their needs.</p>
        </div>

      <section class="brown">
        <div class="container">
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>Through research, branding, iteration,  and usability testing, the Thunderhead cloud storage system has emerged as a solution offering users the ability to collaborate, connect, organize, save and create content. Moreover, it has solved the issue of multi-functionality that users desire.</p>

        <p>I created a user research survey that focused on the following elements:</p>
        <ul class="research">
          <li>Usage</li>
          <li>Competitors</li>
          <li>Preferred Features</li>

          <ul class="research2">
            <li>80% of respondents have used a cloud storage/organization app</li>
            <li>89% of respondents are between the ages of 18-34</li>
            <li>Ease of use, accessibility, affordability, and integration are key preferences</li>
          </ul>
            <p>The two main takeaways from this survey is that most users want accessibility and affordability as their key preferences, and 18 and 34 year olds are vastly different demographics.</p>

          <p>According to user research, a cloud storage system needs to be all things to all people. By combining research, branding, design iterations, prototypes and usability testings, I was able to deliver an application that enables users to share, create and collaborate on content.</p>
          <p>Along the way, I also learned how our best intentions for user flows will always need more flushing out than expected. User flow will always benefit by more user testing. If I could further design Thunderhead, I would continue to explore the color pallette options.</p>
